#Hello Markdown

It is **sooooooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hang of *it* you just:

*remember the basic syntax
* write your doc
*Done!

You can be a wiz at this language and code up stuff like 'console.writeline("Hello Markdown!");'

Can't remember the language? No problem! Just visit one of these resources:
